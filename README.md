# üî• Infinitoe: The Tic-Tac-Toe That Never Ends

A game of tic-tac-toe so addictive, your dopamine receptors will file for a union. Built for the vibes of Gen-Z, this isn't your grandpa's tic-tac-toe. It's a relentless, no-draw, high-octane battle of wits where the board is always in flux.

## ü§î Project Philosophy

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." - Leonardo da Vinci

We started with a complex system of draw prevention, heuristics, and all sorts of fancy algorithms. But then we realized: the best ideas are often the simplest. The core of Infinitoe is a single, elegant rule: a 3-move rolling window. It's a ruthless, yet beautiful, constraint that forces players to think on their feet and adapt to an ever-changing board.

## ‚ú® What Makes This Special

- **Draws are impossible.** The game literally cannot end in a tie.
- **Max 3 moves per player.** Each player can only have three pieces on the board at a time.
- **On your 4th move, your 1st move is removed.** It's a simple First-In, First-Out (FIFO) queue. This forces constant action and creates a dynamic, ever-changing board.
- **Buttery smooth animations** with Framer Motion.
- **Dopamine-hitting effects** for every action.
- **Three levels of AI** to test your skills, from a "lol, random" Easy mode to a "good luck, buddy" Hard mode.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

- **Engine:** TypeScript, with a focus on performance and a clean separation of concerns.
- **State:** A bitboard representation for the board state, allowing for O(1) win checking.
- **UI:** React with Framer Motion, Tailwind CSS, and Lucide Icons.
- **Build:** Vite for a lightning-fast development environment.

## üöÄ Code Deep Dive

### The Engine

The `src/engine` directory is the heart of the game. It's where the magic happens.

- **`Game.ts`**: The main game logic, including the rolling window mechanic.
- **`Board.ts`**: A high-performance bitboard implementation for O(1) win checking.
- **`AI.ts`**: Three levels of AI, from a random-move generator to a minimax-powered beast.
- **`index.ts`**: A clean, simple export of the engine's public API.

### The UI

The `src/components` directory is where the pretty stuff lives.

- **`Infinitoe.tsx`**: The main React component, with all the UI logic, state management, and Framer Motion animations.

## üèÅ Getting Started

```bash

## üé§ Final Words

This was a journey of discovery, from a complex, over-engineered solution to a simple, elegant one. It's a testament to the power of "less is more." We hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed building it. Now go get your dopamine hit. You've earned it.
